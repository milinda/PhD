\begin{abstract}
  Interest on continuous queries on streams of data has increased over last couple of years due to
  the need of derving actionable information as soon as possible
 to be competitive in the fast moving world. As a result of the limitations
 in batch processing technologies from previous generation, distributed
 stream processing systems like Yahoo's \textit{S4}, Twitter's \textit{Storm}, \textit{Spark
 Streaming} were introduced into the fast growing Big Data eco-system.
 Even though there are various different stream processing platforms
 and frameworks on top of them with different capabilities and
 characteristics, in-depth comparative studies of performance, scalability and
 reliability has never been done. Users of these system often face
 difficulties when choosing a system as a solution to a task at hand.
 In this paper we use some of the popular distributed stream
 processing use cases we identified by going through mailing list
 discussions, presentations and publication to evaluate three (
 \textit{Storm, Spark Streaming, Samza}) of the
 most popular distributed processing systems used widely today.
