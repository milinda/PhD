# Notes on 'How Well do Graph-Processing Platforms Perform? An Empirical Performance Evaluation and Analysis'

There are various graph processing platforms by both industry and academia. But we lacks performance comparisons which ease the use of selecting a graph processing platform for different use cases. This paper define process, metrics, datasets and algorithms which can use to compare different graph processing platforms. They also provide results of following the defined process and methodologies to compare 5 different graph processing platforms.

These benchmark will give user valuable insight about each platform on how they are behaving in different types of graphs with different types of algorithms.


## Important Phrases

* Comprehensive experimental method
* it enables informed choices, system and application tuning, and best-practices sharing
* Many types of platforms are being used for different communities of developers and analysts. Addressing a variety of functional and non-functional require- ments, a large number of processing platforms are becoming available
