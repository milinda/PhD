Watched some insightful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0) on Kappa Architecture where everything is a *Stream*. Also watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkS6ZjeR7Q) about linearizability of different messaging and storage solutions. It was a presentation which makes you wonder whether you know the core distributed system design techniques and inspire others to learn about distributed systems. It mainly talks about CAP theorem and consistency guarantees.

I found [Tango: Distributed Data Structures over a Shared Log](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=199947) for tomorrow's reading list. [SAMOA](http://yahoo.github.io/samoa/SAMOA-Developers-Guide-0-0-1.pdf) documentation is also for tomorrow's reading list. Also need to read [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) in near future.
